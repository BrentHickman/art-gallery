    * To Do's

       * MVP:
        >Splash Page with nav toolbar and default gallery shown
          default will likely be square grid, 6 across?, random images from db
          landing page will serve as main interactive gallery
          nav to about page / contact 
        ** stretch goal:
            >on hover effects
            >scrolling gallery
            >edit images in gallery(think lighting effects/changes)
            >store function
        >Images should be clickable and direct to details of each image
          details should include fullsize image, info text, 
        >Gallery Editor
          search fields: color, year, medium, series/group 
          should query db and alter gallery view to show new matching images
        >Identity/Authorization of some kind for db admin
          new db entries will need to fill all fields and supply hosted image link to post

      * DB:
        X Decide on Tech 
          C# SQL DB with REACT Frontend
        >Designate fields
        >set up test data
        >test querys

      
      * Image Library:
        >FROM IMG links stored in db
        >get some test images hosted
          probably [imgbb.com]
        >find a crop size that works best
        >decide how to designate image types
          ex: Main color, medium, subject, date?
        >crop images by type group and optimize
